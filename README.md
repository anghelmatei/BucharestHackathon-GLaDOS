## GLaDOS AI Voice Assistant
 
This project is a Raspberry Pi voice assistant inspired by the robot GLaDOS from the Portal games universe. It uses OpenAI's GPT (interchangeable, we used 3.5 for testing and 4 for presenting it) model for natural language understanding and generation. The assistant can perform several tasks like responding to user queries, searching the web using Tavily, and detecting voice commands to wake it up. Most of the project was built during the 24hrs at The Bucharest Hackathon 2024 Edition, with some improvements made later on for PoliFest.

The 'html' folder is not needed, it was just a requirement from one of the sponsors (Genezio) for the hackathon.
## Features

- Voice activation using Porcupine
- Natural language conversation using OpenAI
- Respond in a changeable personality style
- Web search functionality using Tavily
- Voice response using Pygame
- Is just fun to use (lots of people asked to try it, both at the hackathon and PoliFest)
